Phoneme sequencing subjects rerun for trigger timing 
- 19 (trigger channel flat?), 22 (flat/noisy trigger without obvious onsets), 23, 25, 31 (missing run1 tsv), ?35 (unsure, trigger line trains), 76 (raw tsv format inconsistent)

of note but no need to reprocess
- 28 (trigger trains before listen trigger)
- 52 (high freq noise throughout but line noise filtered good)
