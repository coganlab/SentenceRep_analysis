# SentenceRep Analysis
Python and MATLAB code for analysis of sentence repetition data.

## Task

- Subjects performed a repetition task where they listened to a single word or sentence and then either:
  - repeated after a delay
  - mimed after a delay 
  - passively listened
- Statistical significance of the high gamma response (HG, 70-150 Hz) for each time point on each electrode served as an index of local neural computation (cluster-corrected at p < 0.05).
